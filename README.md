# Designing-a-make-up-retailing-innovation

Spend 2 months on the iteration process. Scoped the problem by carrying 30 interviews with different make-up users and retailers employees. Used these to create 4 personas and customer journeys. Desinged a solution by brainstorming 40 ideas and selected them using a feasibility matrix. Prototyped the solution using an interactive website and storyboards for each persona. Tested the prototypes on users to add improvements and create an implementation and impact plan.
